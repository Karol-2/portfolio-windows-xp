    <article>
      <h4>Junior Angular Developer - Actum Lab</h4>
      <p><strong>Dec 2024 - Jan 2026</strong> | Gdańsk, Poland</p>

      <p>
        I worked on a daily basis with Angular (version 17+, signal-based
        approach), TypeScript, SCSS, RxJS, Git, and Jira. Additionally, I have
        gained experience with Google Material, WordPress, Figma, Go, Google
        Sheets, and Python. Throughout the entire period, I worked as a software
        developer, and since June 2025 I have also been a member of the
        Implementation Team, where I was responsible for data processing.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          To a large extent, I independently implemented a new version of the
          client portal from scratch, including its structure, component
          library, and new as well as improved migrated functionalities. The
          entire solution was based on a unified UI and UX designed in Figma by
          a graphic designer. I ensured consistency in file structure,
          components, UX, and the overall code logic
        </li>
        <li>
          Initiated and implemented the bulk operations section in the product
          portal, migrating technical functionalities to the frontend to
          streamline workflows for both the team and clients.
        </li>
        <li>
          I improved the Implementation Team’s efficiency by creating reusable
          code snippets for the most common operations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Used AI tools and AI agents (Cursor, Gemini, ChatGPT) in my day-to-day
          development work.
        </li>
        <li>
          Created and developed a marketing website in WordPress, where I
          implemented custom HTML, improved the mobile layout, and optimized the
          overall page load time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Conducted code reviews, handled time sensitive helpdesk requests,
          actively participated in project meetings (occasionally leading them),
          and tested the team’s functionalities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Worked in an international team (PL, BR, TR, USA) using both Polish
          and English.
        </li>
